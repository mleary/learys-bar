Quick website for my home bar


## TODO List

* Need to update Github actions for multiple pages
* Need to consider which pages should be rerun on an update(probably not index, just cocktails and current listing)
* Fix logo sizing across pags
* Look at changing out navbar colors (might need to change links then)
