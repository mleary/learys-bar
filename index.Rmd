## Welcome!

Welcome to my home bar!  If you find yourself looking at one of three decanters at my home bar, you should know one of them is poisoned.  The secret to discovering which one, is below.

Just kidding.  I typically keep different spirits in each decanter, normally a house bourbon, a "sipping" bourbon, and a scotch. The house bourbon is typically a cheaper bourbon that is good for cocktails.

As I change out the decanter contents, I will update it here.  For those that know me and aren't tech people (probably finding your way here from the QR code on the bar), it's pretty cool that I can automatically update this website via my phone and Github Actions.  Let me know if you want to know more.
